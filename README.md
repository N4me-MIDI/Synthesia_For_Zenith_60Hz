# Synthesia_For_Zenith_60Hz

This is a re-uploaded / distributed custom resource pack (`.zrp`) for Synthesia in **Zenith**

A custom resource pack (`.zrp`) for Synthesia in Zenith, specifically designed for **Black MIDI** and other complex arrangements. This pack is optimized for the best visual clarity during high note counts and is intended for use with **60Hz displays**. For optimal audio experience, it is recommended to use **OmniMidi**, along with **KDMAPI** (already downloaded)

## Features

* **Optimized for Black MIDI**: Visuals designed to handle extremely high note densities.
* **Designed for 60Hz Displays**: Ensures smooth visual synchronization on standard 60Hz monitors.
* **Vibrant Note Colors**: Distinct and easily distinguishable note colors for complex pieces.
* **Clean Piano Roll**: A minimalist piano roll design to reduce visual clutter.

## Installation

To use this `.zrp` file with Zenith:

1.  **Download the `.zrp` file:**
    * Go to the [Releases page](https://github.com/N4me-MIDI/Synthesia-For-Zenith-60Hz/releases) of this repository.
    * Download the `SynthesiaForBlackMidiX1.zrp` file.

2.  **Put your Synthesia Resource Pack:**
    * Open Zenith.
    * Go to `Modules` -> `Scripted` -> `Module Settings` -> `Open Folder`.
   
3.  **Copy the `.zrp` file:**
    * Place the downloaded `SynthesiaForBlackMidiX1.zrp` file into the "Scripted" folder you just opened.

4.  **Restart Zenith:**
    * Close and reopen Zenith.

## Recommended Audio Setup (for Optimal Experience)

While this pack is primarily visual, having a good audio setup is crucial for Black MIDI and complex pieces. I highly recommend using:

* **OmniMIDI:** A high-performance MIDI synthesizer, ideal for handling high polyphony.
    * Download from: https://github.com/KeppySoftware/OmniMIDI/releases
    * Install OmniMIDI and ensure KDMAPI selected as your MIDI output device in Windows.
* **KDMAPI:** Comes with OmniMIDI.
